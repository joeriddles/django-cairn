# Django Cairn
*The passive trail guide for a Djangonaut's journey.*

This is the future home to the source code for a web site dedicated to
cataloging Django knowledge across the web.

The current plan is as follows:

1. Collect initial static content links, titles and descriptions.
2. Categorize content.
3. Determine UX and UI.
4. Determine data model.
6. Implement views and templates.
7. `<deployment shenanigans>`
8. Research RSS ingestion solution. 
9. Research content review solution.
10. `<draw rest of owl>`

If you'd like to help, I'd love to have it. But as you can see, things are
still a bit mushy.

If you're still interested, add a comment to 
[Issue #2](https://github.com/tim-schilling/django-cairn/issues/2).

If you have specific ideas for the site, feel free to share them with me
how you're most comfortable. The best public location is currently the 
[welcome discussion](https://github.com/tim-schilling/django-cairn/discussions/1).
